### To be Implemented:  

> **ADD**: Implement addition of file/directory inside current directory. Take user input for type(file/directory) and name. 

> **MOVE**: Change current directory to any directory by taking input the complete path to that directory. Error handling should be done for incorrect paths.  

> **ALIAS**: Implement saving directory with an alias. Take input the complete path to that directory and the alias. Error handling should be done for incorrect path and for already-exiting aliases.  

> **TELEPORT**: Change the current directory to any directory by taking input the alias of that directory. Error handling should be done for non-existing aliases.  

> **FIND**: Implement searching all the files/directories with given prefix inside current directory. Take a prefix-string input for search. Output all the files/directories with given prefix.  

> **QUIT**: Terminates the program.
